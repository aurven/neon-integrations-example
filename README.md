# Hello Neon!

This project is a basic Node.js Example for Neon Integrations. It includes a Node.js server script and a web page that connects to it.
The project showcases possibile integrations made with Neon:

* __Neon to Méthode__: Using a Neon Webhook you can translate the incoming object into a Méthode one.
* __Ext to Neon__: You can feed RSS feeds or custom API to translate another provider's object into Neon's.


[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript. This project uses the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework and explores basic templating with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript. If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

← `server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site back-end.

← `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

← `src/`: This folder holds the site template along with some basic data files.

← `src/pages/index.hbs`: This is the main page template for your site. The template receives parameters from the server script, which it includes in the page HTML.

← `src/seo.json`: When you're ready to share your new site or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.
